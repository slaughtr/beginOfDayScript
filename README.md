# _beginOfDayScript_

#### _Java Independent Project for Epicodus - 17 March 2017_

#### By _**Dallas Slaughter (slaughtr)**_

## Description
A script to set up my Epicodus machine at the beginning of the day. Will use atom package manager to put a few of my favorite packages on (namely javac-linter, minimap/plugins for minimap, and highlight-selected), will create a few aliases for git commands and gradle stuff, and change the atom config file to use the following
scrollPastEnd: true
showIndentGuide: true
showInvisibles: true
softWrap: true
Will also auto-download my version of the makeJavaProj script to current directory.


## Setup/Installation Requirements
1. Clone this repository onto your desktop or copy the contents of the .sh file in my repo into your own .sh file. Change gpds alias to your own initals.

2. In terminal, navigate to parent directory where beginOfDayScript.sh resides. Type 'chmod +x beginOfDayScript.sh' without the quotes (this gives you permission to run the script. Stupid Macs). Then, type './beginOfDayScript.sh'

3. Wait.

## TODO (in no particular order)

1. Set up to create .pairs file appropriately (tabs v importante!) Just need to import from gitAndRepoTool, more or less (so bloaty though)
2. Set up to open an incognito chrome window that auto-navigates to github login page.
3. Set up to make the Mac not a Mac anymore (help appreciated)
4. Put on a server so I can just run http://servername.com/beginOfDayScript.sh without using git Clone
5. Additional alias commands, atom packages, individual atom package config edit as necessary, etc

## Technology Used To Create
Atom, bash
